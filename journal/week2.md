# Week 2 â€” Distributed Tracing

For week 2, I Instrumented the backend flask application to use Open Telemetry (OTEL) with Honeycomb.io as the provider.


First I exported and added the HoneyComb API key environment variables to Gitpod

```bash
export HONEYCOMB_API_KEY=""
gp env HONEYCOMB_API_KEY=""
```

I also added the following Env Vars to backend-flask in docker compose

```bash
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT: "https://api.honeycomb.io"
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS: "x-honeycomb-team=${HONEYCOMB_API_KEY}"
OTEL_SERVICE_NAME: "${HONEYCOMB_SERVICE_NAME}"
```

To create Dataset in Honeycomb, all these installation instructions were added to the requirements.txt file
```
opentelemetry-api 
opentelemetry-sdk 
opentelemetry-exporter-otlp-proto-http 
opentelemetry-instrumentation-flask 
opentelemetry-instrumentation-requests
```

I ran the following command to install the dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

After running "docker-compose up" I was able to view the Datasets and trace activities on Honeycomb.io.

## I also learnt some troubleshoot skills for honeycomb API:
- Run : env | grep HONEY
- copy env API keys
- Next, Go to the url : honeycomb-whoami.glitch.me
- Paste the API keys in the search box.

# AWS X-ray

The following command was added to the requirement.txt file in the backend-flask path. 
```
aws-xray-sdk
```
I installed AWS sdk for python with  the following command:
```bash
pip install aws-xray-sdk
```




Next I added the following to json file path: `aws/json/xray.json`
```json
{
  "SamplingRule": {
      "RuleName": "Cruddur",
      "ResourceARN": "*",
      "Priority": 9000,
      "FixedRate": 0.1,
      "ReservoirSize": 5,
      "ServiceName": "Cruddur",
      "ServiceType": "*",
      "Host": "*",
      "HTTPMethod": "*",
      "URLPath": "*",
      "Version": 1
  }
}
```

The `app.py` file was updated with the following:
```python
from aws_xray_sdk.core import xray_recorder
from aws_xray_sdk.ext.flask.middleware import XRayMiddleware

xray_url = os.getenv("AWS_XRAY_URL")
xray_recorder.configure(service='Cruddur', dynamic_naming=xray_url)
XRayMiddleware(app, xray_recorder)
```
<br>

### To create a group named Cruddur in AWS-xray, I ran the following command.
```bash
aws xray create-group \
   --group-name "Cruddur" \
   --filter-expression "service(\"backend-flask\")"
```

### To create sampling rules in AWS. I ran the following command:

```bash
aws xray create-sampling-rule --cli-input-json file://aws/json/xray.json
```

I  Updated docker-compose.yaml with aws-xray daemon environment variables
```yaml
  xray-daemon:
    image: "amazon/aws-xray-daemon"
    environment:
      AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: "${AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID}"
      AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: "${AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY}"
      AWS_REGION: "us-east-1"
    command:
      - "xray -o -b xray-daemon:2000"
    ports:
      - 2000:2000/udp
```
And this:
```yaml
AWS_XRAY_URL: "*4567-${GITPOD_WORKSPACE_ID}.${GITPOD_WORKSPACE_CLUSTER_HOST}*"
      AWS_XRAY_DAEMON_ADDRESS: "xray-daemon:2000"
```
### Troubleshoot
Next I ran docker-compose up.
Here only the frontend port was running. I did some troubleshooting by checking the log files and was able to trace the problem to a file in the backend-flask. I corrected it and ran docker compose up again. Now the backend port was running. AWS-xray port was still not running at this point.
